#Protected Access Modifiers

These are accessible to 
1.  All Classes and Interfaces defined in same package.
2.  All Derived classes in same or different pacakge. A derived class can inherit and access protected members of its base class, regardless of the package in which it’s defined. A derived class in a separate package can’t access protected members of its base class using reference variables.
